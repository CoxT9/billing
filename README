This a a revamp of a billing project I made with a partner for a small business. It was intended to speed up their billing process through the creation of PDF invoices and reciepts, and the mailing of these files.
OldBilling.rb is the origional program, which used Shoes for the GUI.
the new version will include an improved GUI using VisualRuby, as well as a new database system.
